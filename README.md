# DSA Programs in C

This repository contains my solutions for two basic DSA problems.

---

## Program 1: Merge Two Sorted Arrays

This program merges two arrays into a single sorted array.  
If the arrays are not sorted, the program sorts them first and then merges them.

**Concepts used**
- Arrays
- Sorting
- Two pointer technique
- Time Complexity: O(m + n)

## Program 2: Two Sum Problem

This program finds two numbers in an array whose sum is equal to a given target and prints their indices.

**Concepts used**
- Arrays
- Hashing
- Searching
- Time Complexity: O(n)
